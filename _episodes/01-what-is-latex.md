## What is LaTeX?

LaTeX (pronounced Laytec) is a document preparation and typesetting system that has been around since the early 1980s. Unlike a traditional word processor such as Microsoft Word or Libreoffice it works by using a markup language and converting this into a document file, typically a PDF. Where exactly things appear on the page is determined by LaTeX itself leaving you to focus on the content of your document. Like with a wordprocessor you can create chapters, sections and subsections, set the style of certain parts of the text, insert citations and cross references, tables, images, equations etc.

### Why use it?

* Separates layout and content
* Formatting (mostly) handled automatically
* Good handling of citations and references
* Easy to write maths into a document
* Popular in academic publishing, some journals and conferences will supply a LaTeX template.
* Free and Open Source
* Produces beautiful documents

### Why not to use it?

* A bit of an initial learning curve
* Can feel more like computer programming than document writing
* Unhelpful error messages
* Complicated set of addons
* Getting things to look exactly how you want can be hard
* You can't see exactly what the document will look as you work on it (although some editors have live previews)

## LaTeX vs TeX

LaTeX is really a series of macros written in a typesetting language called TeX. These make LaTeX much simpler and easier to use than writing TeX yourself.
